                <p>Ilya Muromets is one of the bogatyrs (epic knights) in Bylinas of Kievan Rus. The tales are set in the time of the Kievan Rus'. Attempts have been made to identify a possible historical nucleus for the character. The main candidate is Ilya Pechersky, a monk of the 12th century who was beatified in the Orthodox Church in 1643. His relics are preserved in the Kiev Monastery of the Caves</p>

Many Byliny center on Dobrynya completing tasks set him by prince Vladimir. As a courtier, Dobrynya seems to be a representative of the noble class of warriors.</p>
